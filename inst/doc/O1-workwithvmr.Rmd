# The __vmr__ package

## Presentation

The __vmr__ package allow you to manage __virtual environment__ with and for __R__.  
You can develop, run tests, build packages binaries easily in a clean environment with R pre-installed and configured.  

It uses [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) tool to manage this virtual environments, call _boxes_. A __box__ is a Vagrant environment (bundle) containing a __virtual environment_ (such as a virtual machine) for a specific __provider__ (such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)).    
Official __vmr__ boxes list is available here :  [https://app.vagrantup.com/VMR/](https://app.vagrantup.com/VMR/)  

> Boxes use default user and password: __vagrant__.  
Boxes are available for development and test, do not use it for production.

Take a [quick overview](vmrPoster.pdf) from userR2022 poster presentation.
